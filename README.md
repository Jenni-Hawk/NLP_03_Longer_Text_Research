# Advanced Topic Modeling Research: Tweets

## ðŸ“– Background:
After conducting the tweet research project, I became extremely curious about how advances in technology could change the way traditional consumer research is thought about and conducted. At the same time, I wanted to go deeper with understanding how how a combination of technologies can work to more accurately uncover what people are saying. In this project I wanted to go deeper on testing BERTopic parameters, understand how different sentence transformers and LLMs perform in uncovering what people are saying. 

I went about this project with a consumer researcher mindset and a data science researcher perspective. My consumer researcher brain had the following hypothesis: 

My data science brain explored solutions, and then I used my consumer researcher brain to evaluate the output. Does the algorithm and resulting output solve the challenges that consumer researchers have? Does it do a better job than a human without the assist of modern AI technology?
