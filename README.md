# Advanced Topic Modeling Research: Tweets

## ðŸ“– Background:
After conducting the [tweet research project](https://github.com/Jenni-Hawk/Advanced_Topic_Modeling_1_Tweets/blob/main/README.md) I was compelled to go even further with my explorations. I wanted to see how advances in technology could change the way traditional consumer research is thought about and conducted. One area of consumer research that hasn't been reconsidered is the survey. In particular, open ended questions (questions that allow peoople to say whatever they want). I wanted to defy the long-held conventions that consumer researchers held about the open-end. 

At the same time, I wanted to go deeper on the technology: deeper on BERTopic parameter testing, deeper on sentence transformer testing, deeper on LLMs. I wanted a deeper understanding of the impact of each of these. 

I went about this project with a consumer researcher mindset and a data science researcher perspective. 

My data science brain explored solutions, and then I used my consumer researcher brain to evaluate the output. Does the algorithm and resulting output solve the challenges that consumer researchers have? Does it do a better job than a human without the assist of modern AI technology?
