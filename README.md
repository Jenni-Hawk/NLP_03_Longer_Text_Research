# Advanced Topic Modeling Research: Tweets

## ðŸ“– Background:
After conducting the tweet research project, I became extremely curious about how advances in technology could change the way traditional consumer research is thought about and conducted. One area of consumer research that hasn't been reconsidered is the survey. In particular, open ended questions (questions that allow peoople to say whatever they want). I wanted to defy the long-held conventions that consumer researchers held about the open-end. 

At the same time, I wanted to go deeper with understanding how how a combination of technologies can work to more accurately uncover what people are saying. In this project I wanted to go deeper on testing BERTopic parameters, understand how different sentence transformers and LLMs perform in uncovering what people are saying. 

I went about this project with a consumer researcher mindset and a data science researcher perspective. 

My data science brain explored solutions, and then I used my consumer researcher brain to evaluate the output. Does the algorithm and resulting output solve the challenges that consumer researchers have? Does it do a better job than a human without the assist of modern AI technology?
